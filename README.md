Simon's World Cup 2018 Playground
=================================

This is a project of myself mainly focusing on playing
with and showing data fetched from [this free API](http://worldcup.sfg.io/).
It is far beyond enough to say just "THANK YOU" to the author of the API.

To finish the done part of the project, I've already learnt a lot
of new stuffs in Python, Jupyter Notebook and many add-on libraries
of Python. It has been a good company through the tournament, at least
as an very loyal helper to me. I use it to check data after matches and
more. It has been a real good process of watching games and programming,
not simutaniously for sure, during these days.

(Very sorry that Germany didn't even enter the play-off stage)
